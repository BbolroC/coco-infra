# Confidential Containers Infrastructure

This repository includes tools and scripts that are common among confidential
containers repositories to support their workflows.

For example, here we host scripts to setup Github self-hosted runners for Continuous
Integration (CI) on our projects.

This repository **is not** meant to host code to, for example, build an infrastructure
to deploy Confidential Containers to end users.
